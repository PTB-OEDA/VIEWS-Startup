 abstract = {We present a method for estimating event-count models when the data is generated from a persistent time-series process. A Kalman filter is used to estimate a Poisson exponentially weighted moving average (PEWMA) model. The model is compared to extant methods (Poisson regression, negative binomial regression, and ARIMA models). Using Monte Carlo experiments, we demonstrate that the PEWMA provides significant improvements in efficiency. As an example, we present an analysis of Pollins (1996) models of long cycles in international relations.},

    abstract = { Governmental and nongovernmental organizations have increasingly relied on early-warning systems of conflict to support their decisionmaking. Predictions of war intensity as probability distributions prove closer to what policymakers need than point estimates, as they encompass useful representations of both the most likely outcome and the lower-probability risk that conflicts escalate catastrophically. Point-estimate predictions, by contrast, fail to represent the inherent uncertainty in the distribution of conflict fatalities. Yet, current early warning systems are preponderantly focused on providing point estimates, while efforts to forecast conflict fatalities as a probability distribution remain sparse. Building on the predecessor VIEWS competition, we organize a prediction challenge to encourage endeavours in this direction. We invite researchers across multiple disciplinary fields, from conflict studies to computer science, to forecast the number of fatalities in state-based armed conflicts, in the form of the UCDP ‘best’ estimates aggregated to two units of analysis (country-months and PRIO-GRID-months), with estimates of uncertainty. This article introduces the goal and motivation behind the prediction challenge, presents a set of evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the forecasting models, describes the benchmark models which the contributions are evaluated against, and summarizes the salient features of the submitted contributions. }

Probabilistic forecasting aims to maximize the sharpness of the predictive distributions, subject to calibration, on the basis of the available information set. We formalize and study notions of calibration in a prediction space setting. In practice, probabilistic calibration can be checked by examining probability integral transform (PIT) histograms. Proper scoring rules such as the logarithmic score and the continuous ranked probability score serve to assess calibration and sharpness simultaneously. As a special case, consistent scoring functions provide decision-theoretically coherent tools for evaluating point forecasts. We emphasize methodological links to parametric and nonparametric distributional regression techniques, which attempt to model and to estimate conditional distribution functions; we use the context of statistically postprocessed ensemble forecasts in numerical weather prediction as an example. Throughout, we illustrate concepts and methodologies in data examples.",

abstract = {Performance measures of point forecasts are expressed commonly as skill scores, in which the performance gain from using one forecasting system over another is expressed as a proportion of the gain achieved by forecasting that outcome perfectly. Increasingly, it is common to express scores of probabilistic forecasts in this form; however, this paper presents three criticisms of this approach. Firstly, initial condition uncertainty (which is outside the forecaster’s control) limits the capacity to improve a probabilistic forecast, and thus a ‘perfect’ score is often unattainable. Secondly, the skill score forms of the ignorance and Brier scores are biased. Finally, it is argued that the skill score form of scoring rules destroys the useful interpretation in terms of the relative skill levels of two forecasting systems. Indeed, it is often misleading, and useful information is lost when the skill score form is used in place of the original score.}

@article{krzy2022,
	abstract = {The field of conflict forecasting has matured
                  greatly over the last decade. Advances in machine
                  learning have allowed researchers to forecast rare
                  political and social events in near real time. Yet
                  the maturity of the field has led to a proliferation
                  of diverse platforms for forecasting, divergent
                  results across forecasts, and an explosion of
                  forecasting methodologies. While the field has done
                  much to establish some baseline results, true,
                  consensual benchmarks against which future forecasts
                  may be evaluated remain elusive, and thus, agreed
                  upon empirical results are still rare. The aim of
                  this work is to address these concerns and provide
                  the field of conflict forecasting with a
                  standardized analysis pipeline to evaluate future
                  forecasts of political violence. We aim to open the
                  black box of the conflict forecasting pipeline and
                  provide empirical evidence on how modeling decisions
                  along all steps of the pipeline affect end
                  results. In this way, we empirically demonstrate
                  best practices that conflict forecasting researchers
                  may utilize in future endeavors. We employ forecasts
                  of targeted mass killings and genocides to support
                  our methodological claims.},

    abstract = { A central puzzle of international relations research
                  is understanding how groups of cooperative states
                  form. While in theory cooperative groups of states
                  can be made up of states with diverse domestic
                  organizations, in practice, groups of cooperative
                  states tend to have similar domestic
                  characteristics. In this regard, the current state
                  of knowledge on international cooperation is
                  lacking. I fill this research gap by analyzing how
                  network relations simultaneously affect the domestic
                  organization of and conflict among
                  states. Specifically, I argue that frequent
                  interactions and dynamic network formation help
                  states signal their preferences, interests, and
                  capabilities. This information helps spread the
                  political institutions of more powerful states,
                  while alleviating information and coordination
                  problems within groups of states. Over time, this
                  creates cooperative communities or politically
                  homophilous groups of states that are more
                  internally cooperative. When these processes are
                  jointly considered, shared institutional
                  characteristics have a null effect on interstate
                  conflict. }

    abstract = { This article presents ViEWS – a political violence early-warning system that seeks to be maximally transparent, publicly available, and have uniform coverage, and sketches the methodological innovations required to achieve these objectives. ViEWS produces monthly forecasts at the country and subnational level for 36 months into the future and all three UCDP types of organized violence: state-based conflict, non-state conflict, and one-sided violence in Africa. The article presents the methodology and data behind these forecasts, evaluates their predictive performance, provides selected forecasts for October 2018 through October 2021, and indicates future extensions. ViEWS is built as an ensemble of constituent models designed to optimize its predictions. Each of these represents a theme that the conflict research literature suggests is relevant, or implements a specific statistical/machine-learning approach. Current forecasts indicate a persistence of conflict in regions in Africa with a recent history of political violence but also alert to new conflicts such as in Southern Cameroon and Northern Mozambique. The subsequent evaluation additionally shows that ViEWS is able to accurately capture the long-term behavior of established political violence, as well as diffusion processes such as the spread of violence in Cameroon. The performance demonstrated here indicates that ViEWS can be a useful complement to non-public conflict-warning systems, and also serves as a reference against which future improvements can be evaluated. }

abstract = {Objective
Evaluating the performance of multiple complex models, such as those found in biology, medicine, climatology, and machine learning, using conventional approaches is often challenging when using various evaluation metrics simultaneously. The traditional approach, which relies on presenting multi-model evaluation scores in the table, presents an obstacle when determining the similarities between the models and the order of performance.
Methods
By combining statistics, information theory, and data visualization, juxtaposed Taylor and Mutual Information Diagrams permit users to track and summarize the performance of one model or a collection of different models. To uncover linear and nonlinear relationships between models, users may visualize one or both charts.
Results
Our library presents the first publicly available implementation of the Mutual Information Diagram and its new interactive capabilities, as well as the first publicly available implementation of an interactive Taylor Diagram. Extensions have been implemented so that both diagrams can display temporality, multimodality, and multivariate data sets, and feature one scalar model property such as uncertainty. Our library, named polar-diagrams, supports both continuous and categorical attributes.
Conclusion
The library can be used to quickly and easily assess the performances of complex models, such as those found in machine learning, climate, or biomedical domains.}

Examples are given showing that the diagram can be used to summarize the relative merits of a collection of different models or to track changes in performance of a model as it is modified. Methods are suggested for indicating on these diagrams the statistical significance of apparent differences and the degree to which observational uncertainty and unforced internal variability limit the expected agreement between model-simulated and observed behaviors. The geometric relationship between the statistics plotted on the diagram also provides some guidance for devising skill scores that appropriately weight among the various measures of pattern correspondence.},

abstract = {Abstract Tweedie regression models (TRMs) are flexible tools to deal with non-negative right-skewed data and can handle semi-continuous data, that is, continuous data with probability mass at zero. The geometric sums of Tweedie random variables lead to the geometric Tweedie distributions. Their corresponding regression models (GTRMs) provide not only additional flexibility to deal with continuous, semi-continuous, heavily right-skewed data but also a possibility of under-variation than TRMs. Estimation and inference based on the likelihood approach for TRMs and GTRMs are challenging owing to the presence of an infinity sum and an intractable integral in the probability function along with non-trivial restrictions on the Tweedie power parameter space. Thus, methods based on quasi-likelihood have been proposed and successfully applied for estimation and inference in these classes of regression models. In this paper, our central focus is upon characterizing as well as comparing TRMs and GTRMs taking into consideration their variation and zero-mass indices. Besides, we attempt to illustrate their application through some data analyses. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges for the computational implementation of such probability distributions and corresponding regression models referring to some available implementations in R.

    abstract = {Real-time forecasts based on mathematical models can inform critical decision-making during infectious disease outbreaks. Yet, epidemic forecasts are rarely evaluated during or after the event, and there is little guidance on the best metrics for assessment. Here, we propose an evaluation approach that disentangles different components of forecasting ability using metrics that separately assess the calibration, sharpness and bias of forecasts. This makes it possible to assess not just how close a forecast was to reality but also how well uncertainty has been quantified. We used this approach to analyse the performance of weekly forecasts we generated in real time for Western Area, Sierra Leone, during the 2013–16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We investigated a range of forecast model variants based on the model fits generated at the time with a semi-mechanistic model, and found that good probabilistic calibration was achievable at short time horizons of one or two weeks ahead but model predictions were increasingly unreliable at longer forecasting horizons. This suggests that forecasts may have been of good enough quality to inform decision making based on predictions a few weeks ahead of time but not longer, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the processes driving the trajectory of the epidemic. Comparing forecasts based on the semi-mechanistic model to simpler null models showed that the best semi-mechanistic model variant performed better than the null models with respect to probabilistic calibration, and that this would have been identified from the earliest stages of the outbreak. As forecasts become a routine part of the toolkit in public health, standards for evaluation of performance will be important for assessing quality and improving credibility of mathematical models, and for elucidating difficulties and trade-offs when aiming to make the most useful and reliable forecasts.},

abstract = {Summary In Bayesian inference, predictive distributions are typically in the form of samples generated via Markov chain Monte Carlo or related algorithms. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis of how to make and evaluate probabilistic forecasts from such simulation output. Based on proper scoring rules, we develop a notion of consistency that allows to assess the adequacy of methods for estimating the stationary distribution underlying the simulation output. We then provide asymptotic results that account for the salient features of Bayesian posterior simulators and derive conditions under which choices from the literature satisfy our notion of consistency. Importantly, these conditions depend on the scoring rule being used, such that the choices of approximation method and scoring rule are intertwined. While the logarithmic rule requires fairly stringent conditions, the continuous ranked probability score yields consistent approximations under minimal assumptions. These results are illustrated in a simulation study and an economic data example. Overall, mixture-of-parameters approximations that exploit the parametric structure of Bayesian models perform particularly well. Under the continuous ranked probability score, the empirical distribution function is a simple and appealing alternative option.},

                  meteorological drought followed by one of the worst

                  subnational variation in drought impact to examine
                  associations between climatic stress and Syria’s
                  political unrest. Climatic stress may produce
                  instability through both immediate hardship and,
                  indirectly, internal migration. Consistent with the
                  internal migration hypothesis, we find less severely
                  drought-stricken Syrian regions more likely to
                  experience protest. We employ nighttime lights as a
                  proxy for population density to examine the
                  association between climatic stress and internal
                  displacement. We find climatic stress decreased
                  nighttime light intensity during the drought
                  period. Increases in nighttime lights from 2005 to
                  2010 are associated with added risk of protest in
                  Sunni Arab areas, suggesting an influx of migrants
                  bolstered local grievances. Our findings support the
                  internal migration hypothesis and suggest extreme
                  climate events may impact civil unrest via
                  geographically and temporally indirect paths. }

                  typically use executed attacks as the dependent
                  variable and test covariates to identify factors
                  that produce terrorism. But attacks are an imperfect
                  measure of terrorist activity because of ‘plot
                  attrition’ — the tendency for plots to derail due to
                  police intervention or other factors. We examine
                  whether the exclusion of foiled plots from event
                  datasets constitutes a measurement problem in
                  terrorism studies. Building on recent advances in
                  plot data collection, we study the correlation
                  between plots and attacks and conduct an original
                  analysis of jihadism in Europe. Our results suggest
                  common research designs predicting terrorism can
                  produce different results depending on whether
                  incidents are operationalized as plots or
                  attacks. Adjusting for state security capability
                  does not solve the problem. Despite its limitations,
                  plot data is a more complete measure of terrorist
                  activity that should be incorporated, when
                  available, in quantitative studies of terrorism. }

                  escalation can forecast civil war onset with high
                  accuracy and over shorter temporal windows than has
                  generally been possible. Our forecasting model draws
                  on “procedural” variables, building on insights from
                  the contentious politics literature. We show that a

To facilitate comparisons across countries and sources, xSub organizes these data into consistent event categories, actors, spatial units (country, province, district, grid cell, electoral constituency), and time units (year, month, week, and day).

Deep learning (DL) models have increasingly demonstrated their prowess in forecasting meteorological elements. However, traditional DL prediction models often grapple with heavy rainfall forecasting. In this study, we propose physics-informed localized graph neural network models called ω-GNN and ω-EGNN, constrained by the coupling of physical variables and climatological background to predict precipitation in China. These models exhibit notable and robust improvements in identifying heavy rainfall while maintaining excellent performance in forecasting light rain by comparing to numerical weather prediction (NWP) and other DL models with multiple perturbation experiments in different data sets. Surprisingly, within a certain range, even when a DL model utilizes more input variables, GNN can still maintain its advantage. The methods to fuse physics into DL model demonstrated in this study may be promising and call for future studies.},

abstract = {Global medium-range weather forecasting is critical to
                  decision-making across many social and economic
                  domains. Traditional numerical weather prediction
                  uses increased compute resources to improve forecast
                  accuracy but does not directly use historical
                  weather data to improve the underlying model. Here,
                  we introduce GraphCast, a machine learning–based
                  method trained directly from reanalysis data. It
                  predicts hundreds of weather variables for the next
                  10 days at 0.25° resolution globally in under 1
                  minute. GraphCast significantly outperforms the most
                  accurate operational deterministic systems on 90\%
                  of 1380 verification targets, and its forecasts
                  support better severe event prediction, including
                  tropical cyclone tracking, atmospheric rivers, and
                  extreme temperatures. GraphCast is a key advance in
                  accurate and efficient weather forecasting and helps
                  realize the promise of machine learning for modeling
                  complex dynamical systems. The numerical models used
                  to predict weather are large, complex, and
                  computationally demanding and do not learn from past
                  weather patterns. Lam et al. introduced a machine
                  learning–based method that has been trained directly
                  from reanalysis data of past atmospheric
                  conditions. In this way, the authors were able to
                  quickly predict hundreds of weather variables
                  globally up to 10 days in advance and at high
                  resolution. Their predictions were more accurate
                  than those of traditional weather models in 90\% of
                  tested cases and displayed better severe event
                  prediction for tropical cyclones, atmospheric
                  rivers, and extreme temperatures. —H. Jesse Smith

    abstract = { Most statistical analyses use hypothesis tests or estimation about parameters to form inferential conclusions. I think this is noble, but misguided. The point of view expressed here is that observables are fundamental, and that the goal of statistical modeling should be to predict future observations, given the current data and other relevant information. Further, the prediction of future observables provides multiple advantages to practicing scientists, and to science in general. These include an interpretable numerical summary of a quantity of direct interest to current and future researchers, a calibrated prediction of what’s likely to happen in future experiments, a prediction that can be either “corroborated” or “refuted” through experimentation, and avoidance of inference about parameters; quantities that exists only as convenient indices of hypothetical distributions. Finally, the predictive probability of a future observable can be used as a standard for communicating the reliability of the current work, regardless of whether confirmatory experiments are conducted. Adoption of this paradigm would improve our rigor for scientific accuracy and reproducibility by shifting our focus from “finding differences” among hypothetical parameters to predicting observable events based on our current scientific understanding. }

  abstract = {Ordinal predictors are commonly used in regression models. They are often incorrectly treated as either nominal or metric, thus under- or overestimating the information contained. Such practices may lead to worse inference and predictions compared to methods which are specifically designed for this purpose. We propose a new method for modelling ordinal predictors that applies in situations in which it is reasonable to assume their effects to be monotonic. The parameterization of such monotonic effects is realized in terms of a scale parameter b representing the direction and size of the effect and a simplex parameter modelling the normalized differences between categories. This ensures that predictions increase or decrease monotonically, while changes between adjacent categories may vary across categories. This formulation generalizes to interaction terms as well as multilevel structures. Monotonic effects may be applied not only to ordinal predictors, but also to other discrete variables for which a monotonic relationship is plausible. In simulation studies we show that the model is well calibrated and, if there is monotonicity present, exhibits predictive performance similar to or even better than other approaches designed to handle ordinal predictors. Using Stan, we developed a Bayesian estimation method for monotonic effects which allows us to incorporate prior information and to check the assumption of monotonicity. We have implemented this method in the R package brms, so that fitting monotonic effects in a fully Bayesian framework is now straightforward.},

Since any given moment generating function generates an exponential dispersion model, there exists a multitude of exponential dispersion models, and some new examples are introduced. General results on convolution and asymptotic normality of exponential dispersion models are presented. Asymptotic theory is discussed, including a new small-dispersion asymptotic framework, which extends the domain of application of large-sample theory. Procedures for constructing new exponential dispersion models for correlated data are introduced, including models for longitudinal data and variance components. The results of the paper unify and generalize standard results for distributions such as the Poisson, the binomial, the negative binomial, the normal, the gamma, and the inverse Gaussian distributions.},

The American Political Science Review 64 (1), 18–34.] pioneering study, students of presidential approval ratings have agreed that major events affect these ratings. Despite this consensus, there is wide divergence in the ways that scholars have selected events for inclusion in models of approval ratings. This inconsistency inhibits direct comparisons across studies and raises the possibility that results are contingent on those selection criteria. Thus, what we have learned about the impact of various factors that may affect approval may depend on the details of selection criteria. Practically, scholars analyzing presidential approval ratings for any theoretical purpose must construct a list of events themselves, which takes considerable time. We propose a set of selection criteria and construct a list of events from 1953 to 2006 that scholars can employ. We also demonstrate that the list of events generates empirical results that comport with extant findings in the presidential approval literature.}

Yet there has been no study of how presidential saber rattling affects international or domestic political outcomes. This study evaluates how presidential saber rattling affects U.S. economic behavior and performance. Theoretically, the study demonstrates that presidential rhetoric affects the risks that economic actors are willing to take, as well as the consequences of these resulting behaviors for U.S. economic performance. Using monthly time series running from January 1978 through January 2005, vector autoregression methods are applied to show that increased presidential saber rattling produces increased perceptions of negative economic news, declining consumer confidence, lower personal consumption expenditures, less demand for money, and slower economic growth. More broadly, the study demonstrates an important linkage between the president's two most important roles: foreign and economic policy leadership. The president's foreign policy pronouncements not only impact other nations, but also affect domestic economic outcomes.},

                  individuals' political views and voting behavior?
                  Inspired partly by the fallout of the financial
                  crisis of 2008, research on this question has
                  proliferated. Findings from studies covering a
                  broadening range of countries and economic contexts
                  highlight several notable patterns. Economic
                  shocks—e.g., job loss or sharp drop in income—exert
                  a significant and theoretically predictable, if
                  often transient, effect on political attitudes. In
                  contrast, the effect on voting behavior is more
                  limited in magnitude and its manifestations less
                  understood. Negative economic shocks tend to
                  increase support for more expansive social policy
                  and for redistribution, strengthening the appeal of
                  the left. But such shocks also tend to decrease
                  trust in political institutions, thus potentially
                  driving the voters to support radical or populist
                  parties, or demobilizing them altogether. Further
                  research is needed to detect the conditions that
                  lead to these distinct voting outcomes. }

abstract = {We analyze the relationship between public approval and presidential success in Congress using time-varying parameter regression methods. Cues from constituency, ideology, and party dominate congressional vote choice, so the effect of public approval of the president is typically marginal. Because the strength of these primary cues varies through time, the effect of public approval on presidential success should also be time varying. Analysis of conflictual roll-call votes from 1953 through 2000 using the time-varying Kalman filter reveals that the effect of public approval on presidential success is marginal and changing through time. These models assume that the time variation is a stochastic process, and finding time-varying relationships may indicate model misspecification. Our theory, however, suggests that this time variation depends on a systematic factor—partisanship. A better specified model that allows systematic parameter variation confirms that the level of partisanship conditions the relationship between public approval and presidential success in Congress.},

If there is no cancellation, the bounds become equalities, and this solves the identification problem. Our classes of time series include every M-state Markov switching multi-variate moving-average models and autoregressive models in which the regime variable is uncorrelated with the observable. Our results include, as particular cases, those obtained by Krolzig (1997) and improve the bounds given by Zhang and Stine (2001) and Francq and Zakoïan (2001) for our classes of dynamic models.

                  We take advantage of recent advances in dynamic
                  models of compositional dependent variables to
                  simultaneously study tradeoffs across multiple
                  slices of the composition of income in the United
                  States between 1947 and 2014. Results Our analyses
                  demonstrate the utility of dynamic compositional
                  models of income shares. Factors that increase the
                  income share of the top income group often also
                  increase the income share of the second income group
                  and decrease the shares of lower groups at different
                  rates. Polarization and marginal tax rates have
                  large effects on relative income shares, while

abstract = {We represent the dynamic relation among variables in
                  vector autoregressive (VAR) models as directed
                  graphs. Based on these graphs, we identify so-called
                  strongly connected components. Using this graphical
                  representation, we consider the problem of variable
                  choice. We use the relations among the strongly
                  connected components to select variables that need
                  to be included in a VAR if interest is in impulse
                  response analysis of a given set of variables. Our
                  theoretical contributions show that the set of
                  selected variables from the graphical method
                  coincides with the set of variables that is
                  multi-step causal for the variables of interest by
                  relating the paths in the graph to the coefficients
                  of the ‘direct’ VAR representation. An empirical
                  application illustrates the usefulness of the
                  suggested approach: Including the selected variables
                  into a small US monetary VAR is useful for impulse
                  response analysis as it avoids the well-known
                  ‘price-puzzle’.},

    abstract = { AbstractMany real time series datasets exhibit
                  structural changes over time. A popular model for
                  capturing their temporal dependence is that of
                  vector autoregressions (VAR), which can accommodate
                  structural changes through time evolving transition
                  matrices. The problem then becomes to both estimate
                  the (unknown) number of structural break points,
                  together with the VAR model parameters. An
                  additional challenge emerges in the presence of very
                  large datasets, namely on how to accomplish these
                  two objectives in a computational efficient
                  manner. In this article, we propose a novel
                  procedure which leverages a block segmentation
                   scheme (BSS) that reduces the number of model
                  parameters to be estimated through a regularized
                  least-square criterion. Specifically, BSS examines
                  appropriately defined blocks of the available data,
                  which when combined with a fused lasso-based
                  estimation criterion, leads to significant
                  computational gains without compromising on the
                  statistical accuracy in identifying the number and
                  location of the structural breaks. This procedure is
                  further coupled with new local and exhaustive search
                  steps to consistently estimate the number and
                  relative location of the break points. The procedure
                  is scalable to big high-dimensional time series
                  datasets with a computational complexity that can
                  achieve , where n is the length of the time series
                  (sample size), compared to an exhaustive procedure
                  that requires O(n) steps. Extensive numerical work
                  on synthetic data supports the theoretical findings
                  and illustrates the attractive properties of the
                  procedure. Finally, an application to a neuroscience
                  dataset exhibits its usefulness in
                  applications. Supplementary files for this article
                  are available online. }
