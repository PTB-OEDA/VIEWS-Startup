This is a simple demo for getting started with the VIEWS data in `R`.  It covers the following topics (among others):

[Getting Started with the VIEWS data tutorial](https://github.com/PTB-OEDA/VIEWS-Startup/blob/main/Brandt-VIEWS2-Demo.md)

[Learning about Tweedie and Exponential Dispersion Models](https://github.com/PTB-OEDA/VIEWS-Startup/blob/main/Brandt-VIEWS2-Demo.md#tweedie-distribution-models)

[Practical Forecast Scoring](https://github.com/PTB-OEDA/VIEWS-Startup/blob/main/Brandt-VIEWS2-Demo.md#practical-forecast-scoring)

It lets you do things like

1. Download the basic `cm` or country-month data
2. Setup the data
3. Make some basic time series and distribution plots.
4. Evaluates parametric density changes in the data using Tweedie models.
5. Generate some forecasts over a training set.
6. Compare the forecasts from the training set model to actual data.

*This is not an `R` tutorial.*  It assumes you already can use some of `R` and want to focus on the logic of machine learning for forecasting this problem.
